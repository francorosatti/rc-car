## Project Overview

This project provides a Python-based interface for connecting an Xbox 360 controller to your computer. The main purpose is to allow the Python script to receive input from the controller and execute corresponding commands or actions based on those inputs. This enables you to use the Xbox 360 controller as a versatile input device for custom automation, control, or interaction within your Python applications.

## Features

- Connects to an Xbox 360 controller via supported libraries.
- Maps controller buttons and analog inputs to Python functions or commands.
- Allows customization of actions triggered by controller events.
- Can be extended to control external devices, run scripts, or interact with other software.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., `pygame`, `inputs`, or other relevant libraries).
2. Connect your Xbox 360 controller to your computer.
3. Run the Python script.
4. Use the controller to trigger commands or actions as defined in your script.

## Example Applications

- Game automation and testing
- Robotics control
- Media playback management
- Custom shortcuts for productivity

## Getting Started

Refer to the code and comments for details on how to map controller inputs to your desired actions. Modify the script as needed to suit your specific use case.
